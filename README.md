## About

An intruder alarm system realised on Raspberry Pi Pico. Our system currently supports following functionalities:

- Passcode setup
- User-friendly GUI
- Alarm activation and deactivation
  - Deactivation over MQTT protocol
- Movement detection and siren activation
- Protection against too many unlock attempts

## Components

In the project we used the following components:
- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico*
- 1x Matrix Keypad
- 1x PIR Sensor
- 1x LCD TFT Banggood Display
- 1x Buzzer

For the implementation details, documentation, or schemes please refer to the `docs` directory. 

Please also note that we actually used a modified version of Raspberry Pi Pico called PicoETF, developed at ETF Sarajevo. The differences are minute but important to state because of possible differences in schematics.
